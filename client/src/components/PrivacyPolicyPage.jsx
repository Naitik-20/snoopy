              A privacy policy is a statement that discloses some or all
              of the ways a website collects, uses, discloses, processes,
              and manages the data of its visitors and customers.
            </p>

            <p>
              It usually also includes a statement regarding the website’s
              commitment to protecting its visitors’ or customers’ privacy,
              and an explanation about the different mechanisms the website
              is implementing in order to protect privacy.
            </p>

            <p>
              Different jurisdictions have different legal obligations
              of what must be included in a Privacy Policy.

              Generally speaking, a Privacy Policy often addresses these
              types of issues:
            </p>

            <p>
              • The types of information the website collects  
              <br />
              • How the website collects data  
              <br />
              • Why the website collects personal information  
              <br />
              • Sharing information with third parties  
              <br />
              • Rights of visitors and customers  
              <br />
              • Policies regarding minors’ data collection
